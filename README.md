# Database Management System

This project is a simple database management system implemented as a single-page application using HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), Express, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. It allows users to view records stored in a PostgreSQL database, search for specific records by name or location, paginate through the data, and sort the records by date or time.

## Features

- Displays records stored in a PostgreSQL database in a table format.
- Provides a search functionality to search records by name or location.
- Implements pagination with 20 records per page.
- Separates the `created_at` column data into separate `date` and `time` columns.
- Allows sorting of records by either date or time.
